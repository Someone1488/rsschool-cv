# About me
After years spent in university and getting several emotional burnouts, I came to the conclusion that my current specialization no longer interested me, and further education will only lead to stagnation and disappointment. So I decided to try myself in somthing new. My choice fell on the profession of frontend developer, because alredy tried it, when I was studying in high school. Despite being completely unqualified in coding, I hope that my determination, ability and desire to learn will help to achieve my goal - become a junior frontend developer.
